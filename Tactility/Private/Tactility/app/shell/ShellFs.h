/**
 * Filesystem access for the shell, over Tactility's real mounts.
 *
 * Upstream BreezyBox mounts a LittleFS partition of its own and reaches it through linker-wrapped
 * libc calls (`-Wl,-wrap,fopen`). Neither works here: the shell runs as a relocated ELF where
 * linker wrapping is unreliable, and the point of the port is to browse the device's actual
 * filesystems rather than a private sandbox. So path resolution is explicit instead of wrapped,
 * and every caller goes through the helpers below.
 *
 * One rule the upstream code does not have to care about: there is no real root. There is no
 * filesystem mounted at `/`; there are several independent mounts (`/data`, `/sdcard`). `/` is
 * therefore synthesised as a listing of mount points.
